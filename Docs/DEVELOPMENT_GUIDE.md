# Link Wars - Development Guide

Welcome to the development of **Link Wars**! This guide outlines the workflow and commands you need to build, test, and run the project using our Monorepo and Docker setup.

## 1. Initial Setup

Before starting, ensure you have **Docker** and **Yarn** installed on your machine.

```bash
# Install all dependencies in the monorepo root
yarn install
```

## 2. Running the Development Environment

We use Docker Compose to orchestrate all services with **Hot Reload** enabled.

```bash
# Start all services (Identity, Cashier, Game-Server, Client-Web)
docker compose up

# If you make changes to package.json or Dockerfiles, rebuild:
docker compose up --build
```

- **Web Portal**: http://localhost:5173
- **Game Client**: http://localhost:5174
- **Cashier API**: http://localhost:3000
- **Game Server**: http://localhost:2567
- **Identity (Keycloak)**: http://localhost:8080

## 3. Daily Development Workflow

### Starting Services Individually
While Docker runs everything in the background, you can also run services locally for faster debugging or specific work:

- `yarn dev:cashier`: Starts the Cashier API with `tsx watch`.
- `yarn dev:game`: Starts the Game Server with `tsx watch`.
- `yarn dev:client`: Starts the Game Client with `Vite` (port 5174).
- `yarn dev:portal`: Starts the Web Portal with `Vite` (port 5173).

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
We follow a strict TDD methodology. Always write your tests first!

- `yarn test`: Runs all tests in the monorepo.
- `yarn workspace <service-name> test:watch`: Runs tests for a specific service in watch mode.

### Linting & Formatting
We use **Biome** for everything. It's incredibly fast.

- `yarn lint`: Checks for linting/formatting issues.
- `yarn format`: Automatically fixes all formatting and import sorting.

> [!TIP]
> **VS Code / Cursor User?** 
> Just open the root folder. We've configured the editor to **Format on Save** and **Organize Imports** automatically using Biome.

## 4. Project Structure

- `services/`: Contains the standalone services.
- `Docs/`: High-level architecture, data models, and guides.

## 5. Adding a New Feature (TDD + MVP Pattern)

We follow a strict **TDD methodology** combined with an **MVP development pattern** for incremental delivery.

### MVP Levels

| Level | Focus | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **MVP-0** | Structure | Minimal working implementation with hardcoded values, no external integrations |
| **MVP-1** | Functionality | Real integrations, persistence, core features working end-to-end |
| **MVP-2** | Polish | Error handling, edge cases, loading states, accessibility |

### Workflow

1. **Define the Requirement**: Read the architecture docs in `Docs/`.
2. **Write a Failing Test**: Create a test file in `services/<service>/src/__tests__/`.
3. **Run Tests**: `yarn test` (verify it fails).
4. **Implement MVP-0**: Write minimal code to pass the test.
5. **Iterate**: Add more tests, implement MVP-1, then MVP-2.
6. **Refactor**: Clean up the code and run `yarn format`.

### Example: Adding Authentication to Web Portal

```
MVP-0: AuthContext with mock state, login button triggers console.log
MVP-1: Real Keycloak integration, token persistence, protected routes
MVP-2: Token refresh, error handling, loading spinners
```

Each level must pass all tests before proceeding to the next.
